				<p>If you uploaded program stuff, someone from our team will be getting that set up ASAP. If not, you can always upload stuff on the programs tab. We'll have this done within a couple of hours usually, and we'll email you when it's good to go.</p>

                <p>Now might be a good time to invite clients via the button on the left. They'll get an email with you and your program name in it, so they'll know they're going to the right place. You can charge clients whatever you want and change their workouts and diet details whenever you feel like it.</p>

				<p>Last but not least—we're here for you. So if there's anything you need, don't hesitate to ping us. We are 100% commited to helping trainers make more money and providing an awesome experience for your clients.</p>
