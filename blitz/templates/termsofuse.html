BLITZ.US DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE. WE ARE NOT A LICENSED MEDICAL CARE PROVIDER AND HAVE NO EXPERTISE IN DIAGNOSING, EXAMINING, OR TREATING MEDICAL CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, OR IN DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF ANY SPECIFIC EXERCISE ON A MEDICAL CONDITION. THE SITE, THE CONTENT AND THE SERVICES ARE NOT PROVIDED IN THE COURSE OF A PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND A PATIENT AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO CREATE ANY PATIENT RELATIONSHIP, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSIDERED A REPLACEMENT FOR CONSULTATION WITH A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL.

You should always consult a physician before starting a fitness program, changing your diet or if you have any questions regarding a medical condition. You should consult with your physician before following any training instructions you receive through the Site or the Services or participating in any event announced on or through the Site or the Services. Not all exercises or activities described on the Site or the Services are suitable for everyone. You should understand that when participating in any exercise or exercise program, there is the possibility of physical injury and/or death. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your physician or 911 (or other similar emergency number if you are outside of the US) immediately. If you feel discomfort or pain, immediately stop the activity causing such discomfort or pain. By using the Services, you represent that you have received consent from your physician to participate in the programs, workouts, and exercises described on the Site.
We are not responsible for any health problems that may result from training programs, products, or events you learn about through the Site or the Services.
